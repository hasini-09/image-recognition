**Image Recognition System :**

Image Database Management: Supports adding and organizing images in a dynamic database using linked lists, allowing seamless management of an unlimited number of entries. Each image is associated with unique metadata, such as an ID and category, ensuring efficient categorization.

Feature Extraction and Classification: Implements advanced feature extraction techniques to analyze image patterns. Uses classification algorithms like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to identify objects, scenes, or specific details within an image.

Real-Time Recognition: Enables real-time image recognition, processing inputs dynamically using pre-trained models. Validates the accuracy of recognition against predefined datasets for robust performance.

Result Analysis and Reporting: Displays recognition results, including identified objects or categories, confidence levels, and metadata. Supports exporting results for further analysis.

Error Handling and Security: Ensures the integrity of the image database by validating input formats and preventing duplicate entries. Incorporates hash-based validation to verify the authenticity of uploaded images.
